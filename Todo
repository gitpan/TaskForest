- More tests
- Display should show start time and actual start time
- Rerun job form
- Time dependencies if it's a foreign time at the start of a new day?? -- offset

- Make sure to document that a job may only appear once in a family.  All
  occurrances of job J in family F refer TO THE SAME RUN.
- Refactor Family::readFromFile
- Family::okToRunToday should get day of week from readFromFile and not
  call localtime
- Family::readFormFile - get rid of $forest

- Think about what should happen if a job's start time with a foreign time
  zone is in a different day than today in the local time zone
- Family::readFromFile change the variable names for thisjobsdependency to
  reflect the fact that it's a time dependency
- Implement help() and usage() in Options.pm
- Die in TimeDependency copy constructor if ref dt ne 'DateTime' 
- default_timezone is not used because of the die in Family.pm.
