  <p>
    Taskforest is a simple but expressive open-source job scheduler that
    allows you to chain jobs/tasks and create time dependencies. It uses
    text config files to specify task dependencies.
  </p>

  <p>
    With the TaskForest Job Scheduler you can:
  </p>
  <ul class="bullet">
    <li>schedule jobs to run at predetermined times,</li>
    <li>have jobs be dependent on each other</li>
    <li>rerun failed jobs</li>
    <li>mark jobs as succeeded or failed</li>
    <li>put jobs on hold, and release them</li>
    <li>release all dependencies on a job</li>
    <li>automatically rerun jobs that fail</li>
    <li>receive custom emails when jobs fail, are retried, or succeed</li>
    <li>check the status of all jobs scheduled to run today</li>
    <li>interact with the included web service using your own client code</li>
    <li>interact with the included web server using your default browser</li>
    <li>express the relationships between jobs using a simple text-based format (a big advantage if you like using 'grep')</li>
    <li>browse job log files using the included web server</li>
  </ul>
