  <p>
    When you release all dependencies from a job, you put that job in the
    'Ready' state.  This causes TaskForest to run the job immediately,
    regardless of what other jobs it is waiting on, or what its time
    dependencies are.  To release all dependencies from a job, run the
    following command:
  </p>

  <div class="code"><pre><code>release --log_dir=l_d --job=Ff::Jj --family_dir=f_d [--log_date=date]</code></pre></div>

  <p>
    where <code>l_d</code> is the log directory and <code>Ff</code> is the
    family name and <code>Jj</code> is the job name and <code>f_d</code>
    is the family_directory.  The log_date is an optional date in the
    YYYYMMD format. If specified, that date's data will be used, instead of the
    current date's.  Dependencies on a job will only be released if the job
    is in the 'Waiting' state.
  </p>

    You can use the "Release" button on the 'Status' or 'View Logs' page.
