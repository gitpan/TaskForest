<div class="width6 last">
  <div class="section_header">Required Options</div>

  <p>
    The following options are required.  If they are not specified on the
    command line, the environment will be searched for corresponding
    environment variables or look for them in the configuration file.  I
    recommend that you specify all options in the configuration file.
  </p>
  
  <div class="option_def"><a name="run_wrapper">--run_wrapper=/a/b/r  [or environment variable TF_RUN_WRAPPER]</a></div>

  <p>
    This is the location of the run wrapper that is used to execute the
    job files.  The run wrapper is also responsible for creating the
    semaphore files that denote whether a job ran successfully or not.
    The system comes with two run wrappers: bin/run and bin/run_with_log
  </p>

  <p>
   The first provides the most basic functionality, while the second
   also captures the stdout and stderr from the invoked job and saves
   it to a file in the log directory.  You may use either run wrapper.
   If you need additional functionality, you can create your own run
   wrapper, as long as it preserves the functionality of the default
   run_wrapper.
  </p>

  <p>
   <em>You are encouraged to use run_with_log</em> because of the extra
   functionality available to you.  If you also use the included web
   server to look at the status of today's job, or to browser the logs
   from earlier days, clicking on a the status of a job that's already
   run will bring up the log file associated with that job.  This is
   very convenient if you're trying to investigate a job failure.
  </p>

   <div class="option_def"><a name="log_dir">--log_dir=/a/b/l  [or environment variable TF_LOG_DIR]</a></div>

  <p>
   This is called the root log directory.  Every day a dated directory
   named in the form YYYYMMDD will be created and the semaphore files
   will be created in that directory.

  <div class="option_def"><a name="job_dir">--job_dir=/a/b/j  [or environment variable TF_JOB_DIR]</a></div>

  <p>
   This is the location of all the job files.  Each job file should be
   an executable file (e.g.: a binary file, a shell script, a perl or
   python script).  The file names are used as job names in the family
   configuration files.  Job names may only contain the characters
   a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and _.  You may create aliases to jobs within this
   directory.
  </p>

  <p>
   If a job J1 is present in a family config file, any other
   occurrance of J1 in that family refers TO THAT SAME JOB INSTANCE.
   It does not mean that the job will be run twice.
  </p>

  <p>
   If you want the same job running twice, you will have to put it in
   different families, or make soft links to it and have the soft
   link(s) in the family file along with the actual file name.
  </p>

  <p>
   If a job is to run repeatedly every x minutes, you could specify
   that using the 'repeat/every' syntax shown above.
  </p>
  
  <div class="option_def"><a name="family_dir">--family_dir=/a/b/f  [or environment variable TF_FAMILY_DIR]</a></div>

  <p>
   This is the location of all the family files.  As is the case with
   jobs, family names are the file names.  Family names may only
   contain the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and _.
  </p>

<div class="new_section_header">The following options are optional</div>

  <p>
  <div class="option_def"><a name="once_only">--once_only</a></div>
  </p>

  <p>
   If this option is set, the system will check each family once, run
   any jobs in the Ready state and then exit.  This is useful for
   testing, or if you want to invoke the program via cron or some
   similar system, or if you just want the program to run on demand,
   and not run and sleep all day.

  <div class="option_def"><a name="end_time">--end_time=HH:MM</a></div>

  <p>
   If once_only is not set, this option determines when the main
   program loop should end.  This refers to the local time in 24-hour
   format.  By default it is set to 23:55.  This is the recommended
   maximum.
  </p>

  <div class="option_def"><a name="wait_time">--wait_time</a></div>

  <p>
   This is the amount of seconds to sleep at the end of every
   loop. The default value is 60.
  </p>

  <div class="option_def"><a name="verbose">--verbose</a></div>

  <p>
   Print a lot of debugging information
  </p>

  <div class="option_def"><a name="help">--help</a></div>

  <p>
   Display help text
  </p>

  <div class="option_def"><a name="log">--log</a></div>

  <p>
   Log stdout and stderr to files.  Before the logging start, the program
   will print onto stdout the names of the log file and error file. The
   program logs incidents at different levels ("debug", "info", "warning",
   "error" and "fatal"). The <a href="#log_threshold">log_threshold</a>
   option sets the level at which logs are written to the stdout file. If
   the value of log_threshold is "info", then only those log messages with
   a level of "info" or above ("warning", "error" or "fatal") will be
   written to the stdout log file. The stderr log file always has logs
   printed at level "error" or above, as well as anything printed
   explicitly to STDERR.
  </p>

  <div class="option_def"><a name="log_threshold">--log_threshold=t</a></div>

  <p>
   Log messages at level t and above only will be printed to the
   stdout log file.  The default value is "warn".
  </p>

  <div class="option_def"><a name="log_file">--log_file=o</a></div>

  <p>
   Messages printed to stdout are saved to file o in the log_directory
   (if --log is set).  The default value is "stdout".
  </p>

  <div class="option_def"><a name="err_file">--err_file=e</a></div>

  <p>
   Messages printed to stderr are saved to file e in the log_directory
   (if --log is set).  The default value is "stderr".
  </p>

  <div class="option_def"><a name="config_file">--config_file=f</a></div>

  <p>
   Read configuration settings from config file f.
  </p>

  <div class="option_def"><a name="chained">--chained</a></div>

  <p>
   If this is set, all recurring jobs will have the chained attribute
   set to 1 unless specified explicitly in the family file. 
  </p>

  <div class="option_def"><a name="collapse">--collapse</a></div>

  <p>
   If this option is set then the status command will behave as if the
   --collapse options was specified on the command line.
  </p>

  <div class="option_def"><a name="ignore_regex">--ignore_regex=r</a></div>

  <p>
   If this option is set then the family files whose names match the
   perl regular expression r will be ignored.  You can specify this
   option more than once on the command line or in the configuration
   file, but if you use the environment to set this option, you can
   only set it to one value.  Look at the included configuration
   file taskforest.cfg for examples.
  </p>

  <div class="option_def"><a name="default_time_zone">--default_time_zone</a></div>

  <p>
   This is the time zone in which jobs that ran on days in the past will
   be displayed.  When looking at previous days' status, the system has no
   way of knowing what time zone the job was originally scheduled for.
   Therefore, the system will choose the time zone denoted by this
   option.  The default value for this option is "America/Chicago".
  </p>
  
  <div class="option_def"><a name="token">token</a></div>

  <p>
    This is a configuration option that can only be set in the
    configuration file.  A token is a dependency.  It is something that a
    job must 'possess' before it can run, if that job needs that token.
    You can create different types of tokens, giving each type a common
    name.  You can also specify how many instances of tokens of each type
    are to exist.  The syntax for specifying the different types of tokens
    and the number of instances each type can have is as follows:
  </p>

  <div class="code"><pre><code>
   +-------------------------------------------------------
01 | ...   
02 | &lt;token T&gt;
03 |   number = 1
04 | &lt;/token&gt;
05 | &lt;token U&gt;
06 |   number = 2
07 | &lt;/token&gt;
08 | ...
   +-------------------------------------------------------
</code></pre></div>

  <p>
    For more details on tokens, please see
    the <a href="/docs/tokens.html">tokens page</a>.
  </p>
  
  <div class="option_def"><a name="calendar_dir">--calendar_dir=/a/b/f</a></div>

  <p>
   This is the location of all the <a href="/docs/configuring/calendars.html">calendar</a> files.  As is the case with
   jobs, calendar names are the file names.  Calendar names may only
   contain the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and _.
  </p>




  <div class="option_def"><a name="num_retries">--num_retries=n</a></div>
  <p>
    This is the number of times to <a href="/docs/configuring/retry.html">automatically retry</a> running a job that
    fails.  The default value is 0.
  </p>

  
  <div class="option_def"><a name="retry_sleep">--retry_sleep=n</a></div>
  <p>
    Wait these many seconds before <a href="/docs/configuring/retry.html">automatically retrying</a> running a job
    that fails.  The default value is 60.
  </p>


  <div class="option_def"><a name="smtp_server">--smtp_server=server_name</a></div>
  <p>
    This is the SMTP server that will be used to <a href="/docs/configuring/email.html">send emails</a> out when a
    job fails, for example
  </p>

  <div class="option_def"><a name="smtp_port">--smtp_port=p</a></div>
  <p>
    This is the SMTP server port.  If not defined it defaults to 25. 
  </p>

  <div class="option_def"><a name="smtp_timeout">--smtp_timeout=t</a></div>
  <p>
    This is the SMTP timeout in seconds. If not defined it defaults to 60. 
  </p>

  <div class="option_def"><a name="smtp_sender">--smtp_sender=s</a></div>
  <p>
    This is the SMTP envelope sender (the text after "MAIL FROM:")
  </p>

  <div class="option_def"><a name="mail_from">--mail_from=f</a></div>
  <p>
    This is the email address that appears in the From: mail header
  </p>

  <div class="option_def"><a name="mail_reply_to">--mail_reply_to=r</a></div>
  <p>
    If a user replies to a received email, the reply will go to this
    address instead of the From: address.  This address is set in the
    Reply-To mail header.
  </p>

  <div class="option_def"><a name="mail_return_path">--mail_return_path=p</a></div>
  <p>
    This is the address to which bounces will be sent if they occur at the
    SMTP server (as opposed to the receiving Mail Transfer Agent).
  </p>


  <div class="option_def"><a name="instructions_dir">--instructions_dir=i</a></div>
  <p>
    This is the directory that stores the contents of the emails that are
    sent by the system.
  </p>


  <div class="option_def"><a name="email">--email=e</a></div>
  <p>
    When a job fails, <a href="/docs/configuring/email.html">emails are sent</a> to this address.
  </p>

  <div class="option_def"><a name="retry_email">--retry_email=e</a></div>
  <p>
    When a job fails, but is being <a href="/docs/configuring/retry.html">automatically
    retried</a>, <a href="/docs/configuring/email.html">emails are sent</a> to this address, as opposed to the one
    stored in the 'email' setting.  If <a href="/docs/configuring/options.html#no_retry_email">no_retry_mail</a> is
    set, then no email will be sent in this case.
  </p>

  <div class="option_def"><a name="retry_success_email">--retry_success_email=e</a></div>
  <p>
    When a job fails, is <a href="/docs/configuring/retry.html">automatically retried</a> one or more times and then
    suceeds, <a href="/docs/configuring/email.html">emails are sent</a> to this address, as opposed to any of the
    others.  If <a href="/docs/configuring/options.html#no_retry_success_email">no_retry_success_email</a> is set, then no
    email will be sent in this case.
  </p>


  <div class="option_def"><a name="no_retry_email">--no_retry_email=n</a></div>
  <p>
    If this is set to 1, then an <a href="/docs/configuring/email.html">email</a> will not be sent when a job fails and
    is being <a href="/docs/configuring/retry.html">automatically retried</a>.  The default value is 0 (retry emails
    will be sent).
  </p>


  <div class="option_def"><a name="no_retry_success_email">--no_retry_success_email=n</a></div>
  <p>
    If this is set to 1, then an <a href="/docs/configuring/email.html">email</a> will not be sent when a job fails, was
    <a href="/docs/configuring/retry.html">automatically retried</a> one or more times and then finally succeeded.  The
    default value is 0 (retry_success emails will be sent).
  </p>
