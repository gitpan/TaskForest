  <div class="new_section_header"><a name="cron">Run taskforest all day with cron</a></div>

  <p>
    This is the kind of line I have in my crontab:
  </p>

  <div class="code"><pre><code>02 00 * * * /a/b/taskforest --config_file=/b/c/taskforest.cfg</code></pre></div>

  <div class="new_section_header"><a name="genpasswd">Allow a user to view the web site</a></div>

  <p>
    Please make sure you read the section
    entitled <a href="/docs/webSecurity.html">"Web Server Security"</a>
    for important security considerations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Having said that, : The userids and passwords are specified in the
    <a href="/docs/runningTaskForestd.html#config_file">configuration
    file</a> using the same format as Apache's .htpasswd files. You can
    see <a href="/docs/runningTaskForestd.html#valid_user">commented-out
    examples</a> of this in the configuration
    file <a href="/docs/runningTaskForestd.html#config_file">taskforestd.cfg</a>. For
    your convenience, the TaskForest distribution includes a program
    called <code>gen_passwd</code> that generates text that you can copy
    and paste into the config file:
  </p>
  
  <div class="code"><pre><code>gen_passwd foo bar</code></pre></div>

  <p>
    The above command will print out somthing that looks like the
    following;
  </p>

  <div class="code"><pre><code>foo:4poVZGiAlO1BY</code></pre></div>

  <p>
    This text can then be copied and pasted into the configuration file.
  </p>

  <p>
    Make sure you stop the server and restart it after making any changes
    to the configuration file.
  </p>

  <div class="new_section_header"><a name="start">Start the web server</a></div>

  <p>
    To start the web server, run the taskforestd program with
    the <code>--config_file</code> and <code>--start</code> options. For
    example:
  </p>

  <div class="code"><pre><code>taskforestd --config_file=taskforestd.cfg --stop
        
OR
        
taskforestdssl --config_file=taskforestd.cfg --stop</code></pre></div>
  

  <div class="new_section_header"><a name="stop">Stop the web server</a></div>

  <p>
    To stop the web server, run the <code>taskforestd</code> program
    with the <code>--config_file</code> and <code>--stop</code>
    options. For example:
  </p>

  <div class="code"><pre><code>taskforestd --config_file=taskforestd.cfg --stop

OR
        
taskforestdssl --config_file=taskforestd.cfg --stop</code></pre></div>

  <div class="new_section_header"><a name="cert">Create a self-signed certificate with openssl</a></div>

  <p>
    This is what works for me (instructions found at <a href="http://www.modssl.org/docs/2.8/ssl_faq.html#ToC25">http://www.modssl.org/docs/2.8/ssl_faq.html#ToC25</a> ).
  </p>

<div class="code"><pre><code>
1) Create a server key

openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key.en 1024

2) Make a decrypted version of it

openssl rsa -in server.key.en -out server-key.pem

3) Create a CSR (Certificate Signing Request)

openssl req -new -key server-key.pem -out server.csr

4) Create a CA Private Key

openssl genrsa -des3 -out ca.key.en 1024

5) Create a decrypted version of it

openssl rsa -in ca.key.en -out ca.key

6) Create a 10-yr self-signed CA cert with the CA key

openssl req -new -x509 -days 3650 -key ca.key -out my-ca.pem

7) Sign the CSR

sign.sh server.csr

   The sign.sh program can be found in the
   pkg.contrib/ subdirectory of the mod_ssl
   distribution.  It is not clear whether or not I
   can include that script in this distribution,
   so for now at least, you'll have to use your
   own copy.  Make sure you specify the locations
   of the files in the taskforestd configuration
   file.

  <div class="new_section_header"><a name="release">Force a Job to run NOW</a></div>

  <p>
    Let's say you have a job J4 that depends on 3 other jobs - J1, J2 and
    J3.  Normally, that setup is fine, but today you really want the job
    to run now.  You don't care whether J1, J2 and J3 run successfully or
    not, as far as J4 is concerned.  What you need to do is release all
    the dependencies off J4.  You also don't want to make a permanent
    change to the family file.
  </p>
  <p>
    This means that regardless of what job dependencies or time
    dependencies J4 has, when you release all its dependencies, it will
    run the very next time TaskForest checks to see if there are any jobs
    that need to be run (determined
    by <a href="/docs/configuring/options.html#wait_time"><code>wait_time</code></a>).
    It's as if those dependencies never existed.
  </p>
  <p>
    A release 'request' is only valid once - once J4 runs, the system has
    no 'memory' of the fact that J4's dependencies were released.  It will
    not change the behavior of the rest of the family.  If J5 depends on
    J4, then J5 will be ready to run, even if J1, J2 and J3 haven't run
    yet. To release all dependencies from a job, run the following
    command:
  </p>

  <div class="code"><pre><code>release --log_dir=l_d --job=Ff::Jj --family_dir=f_d</code></pre></div>

  <p>
    where <code>l_d</code> is the log directory and <code>Ff</code> is the
    family name and <code>Jj</code> is the job name and <code>f_d</code>
    is the family_directory.  Dependencies on a job will only be released
    if the job is in the 'Waiting' state.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can also use the "Release" button on the 'Status' or 'View Logs'
    page on the web site to release all dependencies off a job.
  </p>

  <p>
    Remember: no changes are made to the Family file.  So next time this
    family runs, J4 will still depend on J1, J2 and J3, just like it
    always did.
  </p>








  <div class="new_section_header"><a name="prevent">Temporarily prevent a job from running</a></div>

  <p>
    To temporarily prevent a job from running, you need
    to <a href="hold.html">put it on hold</a>.  When you put a job on
    hold, it will not run even if all its dependencies are met.  It will
    only be run after the hold is <a href="releaseHold.html">released</a>.
    Even after the hold is released, its dependencies need to be met (or
    you need to force a run by <a href="release.html">releasing all
    dependencies</a>).  To hold a job, enter the following command:
  </p>
