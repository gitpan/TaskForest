  <div class="new_section_header"><a name="dst">How does Taskforest deal with Daylight Saving Time?</a></div>

  <p>
    For time zones that observe Daylight Saving Time, on the day that DST
    starts (in Spring) the day has only 23 hours.  On the day that DST
    ends the day has 25 hours.  If you run an hourly job on those days,
    the job will run either 23 or 25 times.  If you prefer, you can have
    your Family file use a timezone that does not observe DST - like GMT,
    for instance.
  </p>

  <div class="new_section_header"><a name="midnight">How can I run jobs overnight?</a></div>

  <p>
    Having a midnight point gives us a convenient time interval within
    which a run of a job is considered valid.  For example, with the
    system as it is now, saying "job J1 has run" means that it has run
    *today*.  If J2 depends on J1, we only have to look for successful
    runs of J1 today.
  </p>

  <p>
    If we don't have a known time interval, then we have to resolve the
    problem that occurs when jobs run for longer than 24 hours.  Let's
    start with a simple example first.  Assume that our Family file looks
    like this:
  </p>

  <div class="code"><pre><code>
+----------------------------------------------------------------
|start=>'00:00',tz=>'America/Chicago',days=>'Mon,Tue,Wed,Thu,Fri'
| | J1( start=>22:00 ) | J2()
+----------------------------------------------------------------
</code></pre></div>

  <div class="example_name">Example 1: J1's run time is 5 hours.  This is what happens today</div>

  <div class="code"><pre><code>

    03:00       J1 Ends
    04:00
</code></pre></div>


  <p>
    So you can see that J2 never gets a chance to run!  At 03:00 on Tuesday,
    the system checks to see if J1 has run for that day, and it hasn't.  So J2
    can't run for that day.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, I could remedy this particular case with the following technique (or
    hack):
  </p>

  <div class="example_name">Example 2: J1's run time is 5 hours. J2's run time is 1 hour.</div>

  <p>
    Change the Family File to say:
  </p>

  <div class="code"><pre><code>
+----------------------------------------------------------------
| # changed the start time, time zone and days of week
|start => '00:00', tz => <em>'GMT'</em>, days => <em>'Tue,Wed,Thu,Fri,Sat'</em>
|
| J1( <em>start=>03:00</em> )
| J2()
+----------------------------------------------------------------
</code></pre></div>

  <p>
    What this does is *shift* the entire Family so that all jobs in it run
    on the same day in the time zone specified.  If you use cron to invoke
    TaskForest, the crontab entry that invokes taskforest does not need to
    be changed.  That can stay the same.  Now, this is what happens:
  </p>

  <p>
    Shifting the start/end of the days by changing the timezones has fixed
    this problem.  J1 still starts at 22:00 Chicago time, and J2 will
    still run if J1 runs successfully.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the jobs in your Family files run in less than 24 hours, you
    can use this method now.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, this is not a universal solution.  What happens if J1's run time
    is 26 hours?  Even with the family as shown in Example 2, J1 ends the day
    after it started. This means that J2 will never run, no matter what we set
    the timezone to be.  This is because no matter what day it is, <em>today's</em>
    run of J1 will never have completed that day.
  </p>

  <p>
    So the current version of taskforest does not support Family files whose
    jobs run for more than 24 hours from the start of the first job to the end
    of the last job, even if each individual job runs for less than 24 hours.

  <p>
    The other thing we're seeing here is that now we have 2 instances of J1
    running simultaneously (for 2 hours), even though that is not the intent
    of the Family file.  This could be a major problem.  J2 never runs.
  </p>
    
  <p>
    I can't think of a foolproof way to resolve this.
  </p>

  <p>
    If we implement rules that require a family to 'complete' all of the
    previous day's jobs until it can run no more - because all jobs have
    completed successfully.  I don't know if this is a satisfactory approach
    or not.  This means that J1's start times will be as follows:
  </p>

  <div class="code"><pre><code>
   Mon: 22:00
   Wed: 00:00
</code></pre></div>

  <p>
    On Tuesday we don't run the Family, because Monday's run hasn't
    completed.  That's fine.  But what about Wednesday?  With this
    definition, Wednesday will never run as well because Tuesday's run
    never completed (there wasn't a run on Tuesday).  So the system has to
    be smart about that and realize that.  And that's fine, until you
    change the family on Tuesday to run a new job J3 after J2.  Then, the
    system needs to know on Wednesday not to wait for look for a
    successful run of J3 for Monday's run (because J3 didn't exist on
    Monday).  Which means that the system needs to know your change
    control history.  Which is a whole other problem.

  <div class="new_section_header"><a name="long">Does TaskForest support jobs that run for longer than 24 hours?</a></div>

  <p>
    No.  For a detailed explanation, please see <a href="#midnight">the
    answer to the previous FAQ</a>.
  </p>


  <div class="new_section_header"><a name="tz">What time zones are available?</a></div>

  <p>
    To see a list of all time zones you may use, you can read the perldoc
    for <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/DateTime-TimeZone/lib/DateTime/TimeZone/Catalog.pm">DateTime::TimeZone::Catalog</a>.
  </p>
  

  <div class="new_section_header"><a name="tokens">Can I prevent too many jobs from running simultaneously?</a></div>

  <p>
    Yes.  You can use <a href="/docs/tokens.html">tokens</a> to limit how
    many jobs of a class may run simultaneously.  If these jobs all use
    the same token, you can set the cardinality of the token to the upper
    limit on the number of jobs that may run simultaneously.
  </p>


  <div class="new_section_header"><a name="missing_logs">On the web page, why can't I click on the status of a job to see the logs?</a></div>

  <p>
    You're probably using 'run' as
    the <a href="/docs/configuring/options.html#run_wrapper"><code>run_wrapper</code></a>
    instead of 'run_with_log'.  The former will not generate log files,
    and therefore will not generate the links.  The latter will.
  </p>


  <div class="new_section_header"><a name="release">What is the difference between releasing a hold and releasing all dependencies?</a></div>

  <p>
    When a job is on hold, it will never run during the current day.  Once
    you release a hold on a job, then the job is 'back to normal' and it
    will run once its dependencies are met.  When you release all
    dependencies on a job, it will run right away, even if all its
    dependencies have not been met.  What's important to realize is that
    if a job is on Hold, that takes priority over whether or not you can
    release all dependencies.  The website does not allow you to release
    all dependencies on a job that's on hold.  First you must release the
    hold, and only then can you release all dependencies.
