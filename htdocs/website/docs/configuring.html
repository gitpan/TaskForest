  <p>
    There are two main parts to configuring TaskForest: configuring the
    Family files that specify job dependencies, and setting the options
    that determine TaskForest's behavior.  
  </p>

  <div class="new_section_header">Precedence of Different Options Sources</div>
  <p>
    All settings (required and optional) may be specified in a variety of
    ways: command line, environment variable and config file. The order of
    preferences is this: Most options have default values. Settings
    specified in the config file override those defaults. Settings
    specified in environment variables take override those specified in
    the config file and the default values. Setting specified on the
    command line override those specified in envrionment variables, and
    those specified in the config files and the default values.
  </p>

  <p>
    The names of the environment variable are the same as the names of the
    settings on the command line (or in the config file), but they should
    be in UPPER CASE, with ``TF_'' prepended. For example, the environment
    variable name for the '<a href="/docs/configuring/options.html#run_wrapper">run_wrapper</a>' setting is 'TF_RUN_WRAPPER'.
