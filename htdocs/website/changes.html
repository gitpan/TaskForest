  Enhancements
</p>
      <p class="front_news">
        There are two main enhancements in this release.  The first is
        that now you can configure TaskForest to <a href="/docs/configuring/retry.html">automatically retry</a>
        running a job if it fails.  The number of times it retries, as
        well as the amount of time between retries is configurable on a
        per-job basis.
      </p>
      <p class="front_news">
        TaskForest now also features a very powerful email system.  You
        can configure TaskForest to <a href="/docs/configuring/email.html">email you when a job fails</a>, when a job
        is retried, and when a job suceeds after failing and being
        retried.  Each kind of email can be sent to a different email
        address, and these email addresses can be configured system-wide,
        or for each job, or for anything in the middle.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have developed your own run wrapper, please be advised that
        the interface to the run wrappers has changed.  Instead of being
        passed parameters as command line arguments, the wrappers now look
        for environment variables.  
      </p>

<p>
  Enhancements and Minor Bug Fixes
</p>
<ul class=bullet>
      <li class="front_news">
        Starting in this release, you can now place a Waiting
        job <a href="/docs/hold.html">on hold</a>. If a job is placed on
        hold, it will not run during the current day even if all its
        dependencies are met.  The only way to make it run as normal is if
        you first release the hold off the job.
      </li>
      <li class="front_news">
        The taskforestd web server now supports
        the <a href="/docs/configuring/options.html#default_time_zone">default_time_zone</a>
        option.  This new configuration option will control how times are
        displayed in the 'logs' page, when the time zone in which the job
        ran is not known.
      </li>
      <li>
        This version now gracefully handles the case where a job is marked
        for rerun and then removed from the Family file before it has the
        chance to rerun.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a job fails, its status line on the web page is now colored.
      </li>
      <li>
        The web site now prunes out carriage returns from job files. This would cause
        interpreted scripts to fail because the '#!' line contained a \r.
      </li>
      <li>
        This version fixes a few test cases that wouldn't run properly
        during certain times of the day.
      </li>
</ul>
  

<div class="new_section_header"><a name="1.33"></a>1.33 Mon Jun 1 2009</div>
<p>
  Enhancements.
</p>
<ul class="bullet">
  <li>
    Added support for external dependencies (jobs depending on jobs that
    are in other families.
  </li>
  <li>
    Removed the VERSION string from all the .pm files, and moved it to
    Makefile.PL.  Thils will mean less diffs between versions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Got rid of unused code.
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved some test cases, to reduce the risk of false test failures. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a bug where the last entry of a recurring job was sometimes not run.
  </li>
  <li>
    Modified taskforestd and taskforestdssl to accept the 'chained' option in the config file.
  </li>
</ul>
  

  

<div class="new_section_header"><a name="1.26"></a>1.26 Tue May 19 2009</div>
<p>
Minor bug fix
</p>
<ul class="bullet">
  <li>
    There was an unnecessary call to 'use Date::Calc' in Calendar.pm.  I
    didn't notice it, because I have it installed. It is not being used. It
    may cause tests to fail.  I have removed the line.
  </li>
</ul>
  

<div class="new_section_header"><a name="1.25"></a>1.25 Mon May 18 2009</div>
<p>
Enhancements
</p>
<ul class="bullet">
  <li>
    TaskForest now
    supports <a href="/docs/configuring/calendars.html">calendars</a>.  A
    calendar is a set of rules that defines on what days a job may run.
    Each rule can may or may not conclusively determine whether or not a
    Family should run today.  The rules are evaluated in the order in
    which they are specified.  The last rule that conclusively determines
    whether of not a Family should run wins, in the case of conflicting
    rules.  If none of the rules is conclusive, then the Family will not
    run today.  You can set rules to specify certain dates or ranges of
    dates, or specific days, like "third friday of every month."
  </li>
  <li>
    Added an FAQ section to the website.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed small bug in REST website where logs were not being displayed for
    jobs that ran earlier today (but yesterday by its family's timezone)
  </li>


</ul>


<div class="new_section_header"><a name="1.24"></a>1.24 Sun Apr 26 2009</div>
<p>
Enhancements
</p>
<ul class="bullet">
  <li>
    Added support for tokens, which can be used to control how many jobs can run simultaneously.
  </li>
  <li>
    Formalized the way Families with foreign time zones are handled.  This
    allows you to 'time shift' your family, essentially allowing your
    family to run for 24 hours in a later timezone.  This shifts the end
    of day towads the end of the family's running time.
  </li>
</ul>

  

<div class="new_section_header"><a name="1.23"></a>1.23 Thu Mar 24 2009</div>
<p>
  Bug fix
</p>
<ul class="bullet">
  <li>
    This release fixes a nasty bug where Family files were not being
    parsed properly if the files were in DOS format (with CRLF endings,
    instead of just LF).  Unfortunately, most web browsers save textarea
    text with CRLF, so a Family file that was originally in Unix format
    (LF) could wind up being in DOS (CRLF) format if you edited it via the
    website.
  </li>
</ul>

  

<div class="new_section_header"><a name="1.22"></a>1.22 Mon Mar 23 2009</div>
<p>
  Feature Addition and minor bug fix
</p>
<ul class="bullet">
  <li>
    Added the ability to release all dependencies from a job.  This makes
    the job available to run immediately, regardless of how many jobs it
    is supposed to wait for, or what time dependency it has.  Releasing a
    job effectively changes its status from 'Waiting' to 'Ready.'  This
    option is only available to jobs that are currently in the 'Waiting'
    state.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a minor bug where status on the website was sometimes showing a
    previous day's status if the website had been up for more than a day.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added a line break between the words in the headers in the status and
    log pages on the website, so that the table doesn't take up too much
    horizontal space.
  </li>
  <li>
    Eliminated a debug message saying that the ignore_regex option changed
    every time the system cycled.
  </li>
</ul>
  

<div class="new_section_header"><a name="1.21"></a>1.21 Thu Mar 12 2009</div>
<p>
  Bug fix
</p>
<ul class="bullet">
  <li>
Fixed a bug that was causing the rerun and mark commands run with the
  --cascade or --dependents_only flag to print an error message when
  there was, in fact, no error, and possibly exit before rerunning or
  marking all requested jobs.
  </li>
</ul>


<div class="new_section_header"><a name="1.20"></a>1.20 Tue Mar 10 2009</div>
<p>
  Minor bug fixes and documentation changes
</p>
<ul class="bullet">
  <li>
    Fixed a bug where the end time wasn't being calculated properly.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added some licensing text to comply with yui licensing requirements.
  </li>
</ul>


  
<div class="new_section_header"><a name="1.19"></a>1.19 Sat Mar 07 2009</div>
<p>
  Minor bug fixes and documentation changes
</p>
<ul class="bullet">
  <li>
    In Log page, successful job should show 'mark Failure' not 'mark Success'.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added log_date to website to make Rerun/Mark of a job from a previous
    day work as expected.
  </li>
  <li>
    Changed RESTful service header and docs - added log_date.
  </li>
</ul>


<div class="new_section_header"><a name="1.18"></a>1.18 Fri Mar 06 2009</div>

<p>
  All of the changes in this release are related to the website.
</p>
<ul class="bullet">
  <li>
  Made sure that if a job file dies after the fork but before ceding
  control back to the wrapper, you can at least see its log, if it was run
  with run_with_log.
  </li>
  <li>
    The website now shows the log file for running jobs, not just jobs
    that have completed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed bug where marking a job as Success was not working after it had
    been marked as Failure.
  </li>
  <li>
    Moved mark and rerun forms to buttons on the status and logs tables
  </li>
  <li>
    Changed website to a horizontal layout, so that we have the full
    window width for tables.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a bug so that rerun jobs log files are displayed correctly on
    the web site.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added 'Cache-Control: Public' HTTP response header to allow Firefox 3
    to cache SSL pages which it does not do by default. This greatly
    improves website performance if you're using Firefox 3.  Firefox 2
    does not support the Cache-Control response header, so the website
    will be slower if you're using SSL and Firefox 2 or earlier.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added the 'help' and 'about' documentation sections to the website.
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="new_section_header"><a name="1.17"></a>1.17 Sat Feb 21 2009</div>

<p>
The major change in this release is the addition of an alternative run
wrapper script called run_with_log.  It performs the same functions as the
original wrapper, and also creates a log file that captures both STDOUT
and STDERR of the job being run.  On the website you can now display the
log file of any running or completed job, by clicking on the displayed
status of the job.  The RESTful web service also supports this.  A couple
of entries have also been added to the HOWTO section of the documentation.
</p>

<div class="new_section_header"><a name="1.16"></a>1.16 Wed Feb 18 2009</div>

<p>
Minor bug fix.  An incorrect test job file was shipped in the previous
version.  This file relied on /bin/bash, and not /bin/sh.  This caused
test 017 to fail on any machine that did not have /bin/bash.  The file has
been fixed in this release.
</p>

<div class="new_section_header"><a name="1.15"></a>1.15 Sun Feb 15 2009</div>

<p>
The ordering of jobs displayed by the status command was changed.  The
status command now accepts a --date option, to view jobs that ran on a
previous date.  When run for the current day, the status command now also
displays all jobs that ran that are not currently in any Family.  This
handles the case where the jobs are removed from family files intra-day,
after running.  These jobs are displayed using the newly-supported
default_time_zone option.
</p>

<p>
This release also introduces taskforestd, a perl-only web server that
implements a RESTful web service that can be used by programatic clients
to access the Taskforest system.  The web server also includes a web site
that can be used by humans to interact with Taskforest.  The web server
uses Basic Authentication to authenticate the user, so if you wish to use
it outside an intranet, you should use taskforestdssl, the SSL version of
the program.  
</p>

<div class="new_section_header"><a name="1.14"></a>1.14 Thu Jan 22 2009</div>

<p>
A new config option (and command line argument) was added.  The
ignore_regex option instructs the system to ignore any Family files whose
names match the regular expressions specified by this option.  It's
primarily used to ignore .bak and ~ files left by text editors.  Also
fixed a bug so that invalid file names are excluded.
</p>

<div class="new_section_header"><a name="1.13"></a>1.13 Mon Jun 02 2008</div>

<p>
The behavior of recurring jobs that are scheduled in a foreign time zone
was not well defined.  Now, the 'start' and 'until' of recurring jobs are
always based on the most specific timezone of the job. 
</p>

<div class="new_section_header"><a name="1.12"></a>1.12 Sun Jun 01 2008</div>

<p>
A border-condition bug dealing with foreign timezones crossing a date
boundary was fixed. 
</p>

<div class="new_section_header"><a name="1.11"></a>1.11 Wed May 28 2008</div>

<p>
Minor errors in the documentation and logging
were fixed. A test case that was returing
false negatives was made more robust. 
</p>

<div class="new_section_header"><a name="1.10"></a>1.10 Mon May 26 2008</div>

<p>
Syntax error checking was added to the Family
file parser.  Optional logging of STDOUT and
STDERR is now possible.  The mark and rerun
commands can now act on just the job specified,
or on all its dependents or on both - the job and
its dependents.  Finally, a config file can now
be used in lieu of command-line options or
environment variables. 
</p>

<p>New options are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>--log</li>
  <li>--config_file</li>
  <li>--chained</li>
  <li>--log_threshold</li>
  <li>--log_file</li>
  <li>--err_file</li>
</ul>

<p>
A sample config file can be found in the main
directory as well as in the pod for TaskForest.
</p>

<p>
Please see the TaskForest pod for more details:
perldoc TaskForest
OR
man TaskForest
</p>

<p>
Because of these changes, there are two new
dependencies:
</p>

Log::Log4perl version 1.16 or higher<br>
Config::General version 2.38 or higher<br>

<div class="new_section_header"><a name="1.09"></a>1.09 Sun Apr 27 2008</div>
     
<p>
    Two new scripts were added: 'rerun' schedules
    A job to be rerun, and 'mark' marks a
    previously job as Success or Failure.  A new
    'chained' option was added to the definition
    of repeat jobs, and a '--collapsed' option was
    added to the status script.
</p>
    
    <ul class="bullet">
    
    <li> The 'rerun' script makes a job available to be
       rerun, regardless of whether or not it ran
       successfuly.  It does this by renaming the
       job's log files from FF.JJ.* to
       FF.JJ--Orig_n--.* where n is an integer that
       starts at 1 for the first rerun, and is
       incremented by one at every rerun.
    </li>
    
    <li> The 'mark' job marks a job as 'Success' or
       'Failure', regardless of whether or not it ran
       successfully.  It does this by renaming the job
       rc file from FF.JJ.x to FF.JJ.0 (in the case of
       Success) or FF.JJ.1 (in the case of Failure).
       If the job's status is already as requested, a
       warning is printed, and nothing is done.
    </li>
    
    <li> By default, repeat jobs (those that have the
       'every' and 'until' options) have only one
       dependency - their time dependency.  They are
       not dependent on each other.  In retrospect,
       the correct behavior should have been to make
       the jobs also dependent on each other.
       Consider the case where a job is to run every
       hour, but for whatever reason, taskforest does
       not run until half-way through the day.  This
       would cause half of the jobs to run at the same
       time at the first opportunity.  The new
       'chained' option makes the repeat jobs
       dependent on each other.
    </li>
    
    <li> Also related to repeat jobs: the new
       --collapsed option to the status command
       prevents repeat jobs that are in the 'Waiting'
       state from being displayed.  This is especially
       useful when you have a job scheduled to be run
       once every minute, and it's only 8:00 a.m.  You
       probably wouldn't want to see 960 entries when
       one would suffice.
    </li>
    </ul>
    
<div class="new_section_header"><a name="1.08"></a>1.08 Mon Apr 07 20:52:00 2008</div>
<p>
     A couple of the files required for the most recent test case was
     missing from the distribution.  Added those files to the
     distribution.  No code changes are present in this distribution.
</p>
     
<div class="new_section_header"><a name="1.07"></a>1.07 Sun Apr 06 20:50:00 2008</div>
<p>
     A major bug was fixed in this release. Long-running jobs (that ran for
     longer than the wait time, or longer than the time between two
     invocations of taskforest) were not recognized as such.  This caused
     the jobs to be marked as 'Ready' and not 'Running', causing them to
     be run again.  All users are urged to upgrade to this release and
     make sure to use the current version of the 'run' wrapper.
</p>
