        There are two main enhancements in this release.  The first is
        that now you can configure TaskForest to <a href="/docs/configuring/retry.html">automatically retry</a>
        running a job if it fails.  The number of times it retries, as
        well as the amount of time between retries is configurable on a
        per-job basis.
      </p>
      <p class="front_news">
        TaskForest now also features a very powerful email system.  You
        can configure TaskForest to <a href="/docs/configuring/email.html">email you when a job fails</a>, when a job
        is retried, and when a job suceeds after failing and being
        retried.  Each kind of email can be sent to a different email
        address, and these email addresses can be configured system-wide,
        or for each job, or for anything in the middle.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have developed your own run wrapper, please be advised that
        the interface to the run wrappers has changed.  Instead of being
        passed parameters as command line arguments, the wrappers now look
        for environment variables.

        Starting in this release, you can now place a Waiting
        job <a href="/docs/hold.html">on hold</a>. If a job is placed on
        hold, it will not run during the current day even if all its
        dependencies are met.  The only way to make it run as normal is if
        you first release the hold off the job.
      </p>
      <p class="front_news">
        The taskforestd web server now supports
        the <a href="/docs/configuring/options.html#default_time_zone">default_time_zone</a>
        option.  This new configuration option will control how times are
        displayed in the 'logs' page, when the time zone in which the job
        ran is not known.
      </p>
      <p>
        This version now gracefully handles the case where a job is marked
        for rerun and then removed from the Family file before it has the
        chance to rerun.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a job fails, its status line on the web page is now colored.
      </p>
      <p>
        The web site now prunes out carriage returns from job files. This would cause
        interpreted scripts to fail because the '#!' line contained a \r.

      You can now have a job in one Family depend on the completion of a job in

        TaskForest now
        supports <a href="/docs/configuring/calendars.html">calendars</a>.
        A calendar is a set of rules that defines on what days a job may
        run.  Each rule can may or may not conclusively determine whether
        or not a Family should run today.  The rules are evaluated in the
        order in which they are specified.  The last rule that
        conclusively determines whether of not a Family should run wins,
        in the case of conflicting rules.  If none of the rules is
        conclusive, then the Family will not run today.  You can set rules
        to specify certain dates or ranges of dates, or specific days,
        like "third friday of every month."

    <p class="front_news">
      This release introduces the concept of tokens.  A token is a new
      kind of dependency.  If a job depends on a token, it must acquire
      a free token before it can run, or wait for another job to release
      a token after completion.  Since there is a finite set of tokens,
      you can use tokens to prevent too many jobs from running at the
      same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if there are 20 jobs that rely on token T, but only 5
      instances of the token, only a maximum of 5 of those jobs may run
      at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      This release also formalizes the way Families with foreign time
      zones are handled.  This allows you to 'time shift' your family,
      essentially allowing your family to run for 24 hours in a later
      timezone.  This shifts the end of day towads the end of the
      family's running time.

      This release fixes a nasty bug where Family files were not being
      parsed properly if the files were in DOS format (with CRLF endings,
      instead of just LF).  Unfortunately, most web browsers save textarea
      text with CRLF, so a Family file that was originally in Unix format
      (LF) could wind up being in DOS (CRLF) format if you edited it via
      the website.

      New in this version is the ability to release all dependencies from
      a job.  This makes the job available to run immediately, regardless
      of how many jobs it is supposed to wait for, or what time dependency
      it has.  Releasing a job effectively changes its status from
      'Waiting' to 'Ready.'  This option is only available to jobs that
      are currently in the 'Waiting' state.

      The 'Cache-Control: Public' HTTP response header was added to allow Firefox 3 to
      cache SSL pages which it does not do by default. This greatly improves
      website performance if you're using Firefox 3.  Firefox 2 does not
      support the Cache-Control response header, so the website will be slower
      if you're using SSL and Firefox 2 or earlier.

      The major change in this release is the addition of an alternative run
      wrapper script called run_with_log.  It performs the same functions as
      the original wrapper, and also creates a log file that captures both
      STDOUT and STDERR of the job being run.
    </p>
    <p class="front_news">
      On the website you can now display the log file of any running or
      completed job, by clicking on the displayed status of the job.
      The RESTful web service also supports this.  A couple of entries
      have also been added to the HOWTO section of the documentation.
