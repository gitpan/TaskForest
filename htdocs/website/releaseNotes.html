      All of the changes in these releases are related to the website.
      The layout has been changed so that wide tables are more easily
      displayed.  Online documentation has been added.  Jobs can now be
      rerun and marked directly from the status and log directories.
    </p>
    <p class="front_news">
      The 'Cache-Control: Public' HTTP response header was added to allow Firefox 3 to
      cache SSL pages which it does not do by default. This greatly improves
      website performance if you're using Firefox 3.  Firefox 2 does not
      support the Cache-Control response header, so the website will be slower
      if you're using SSL and Firefox 2 or earlier.

      The major change in this release is the addition of an alternative run
      wrapper script called run_with_log.  It performs the same functions as
      the original wrapper, and also creates a log file that captures both
      STDOUT and STDERR of the job being run.
    </p>
    <p class="front_news">
      On the website you can now display the log file of any running or
      completed job, by clicking on the displayed status of the job.
      The RESTful web service also supports this.  A couple of entries
      have also been added to the HOWTO section of the documentation.
