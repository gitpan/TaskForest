  <div class="section_header">TaskForest Design Philosophy</div>
  <p>
    The TaskForest Job Scheduler is designed with the philosophy that a
    program should be no more complicated that the minimum amount required
    to achieve its objectives.  Complicated functions can be achieved by a
    conjunction of simpler functions.
  </p>

  <p>
    To illustrate this, TaskForest has been designed to run as a single
    command that, once invoked from the command line, launches any jobs
    that need to be run, and then sleeps for a bit and then tries again.
    If you want, the <code>taskforest</code> script can also exit and be
    run repeatedly.  It is a stateless application.  You could
    launch <code>taskforest</code> once a day, and have it run all day, or
    you could run it once every minute (for example) using cron.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since TaskForest does not need any graphical interface, it can be run
    on headless servers that don't have X installed.  If you would prefer
    a graphical interface, it also comes with its own web server so that
    you can administer the application using any standard web browser.  We
    also provide you a RESTful API that allow you to write your own web
    clients, so that you can control TaskForest from within your program.
    Everything you need to do to configure the system can be done by
    editing text files.  More on that in the next section.
