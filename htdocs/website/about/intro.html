  <p>
    A Job Scheduler is an application that is responsible for scheduling
    and running programs (also known as jobs or tasks).  The user
    specifies dependencies between jobs, and the job scheduler runs each
    job only after all its dependencies have been met.  Dependencies may
    be the successful completion of another job (the prerequisite job), or
    a certain time of day, or ownership of a limited resource or token. 
  </p>

  <p>
    The job scheduler is also responsible for allowing the operator to
    rerun failed (or even successful) jobs, mark jobs as having succeeded
    or failed, and querying the status of all the jobs that are scheduled
    to run.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Collections of jobs that are dependent on each other are known as
    Families.  Some schedulers call Families "Job Streams."
