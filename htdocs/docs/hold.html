  <p>
    When you put a job on hold, it will not run duringthe current day even if all its
    dependencies are met.  It will only be run after the hold is released.
    Even after the hold is released, its dependencies need to be met (or
    you need to force a run by <a href="release.html">releasing all dependencies</a>).  To hold a
    job, enter the following command:
  </p>

  <div class="code"><pre><code>release --log_dir=l_d --job=Ff::Jj --family_dir=f_d [--log_date=date]</code></pre></div>

  <p>
  <p>
    where <code>l_d</code> is the log directory and <code>Ff</code> is the
    family name and <code>Jj</code> is the job name and <code>f_d</code>
    is the family_directory.  The log_date is an optional date in the
    YYYYMMDD format. If specified, that date's data will be used, instead
    of the current date's.  A job will only be put on hold if it is in the
    'Waiting' state.
  </p>
