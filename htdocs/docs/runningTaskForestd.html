  <div class="section_header">Running the TaskForest Web Server</div>
  <p>
    The TaskForest package includes two simple, low-footprint web
    servers, called <code>taskforestd</code>
    and <code>taskforestdssl</code>, written in perl. They are
    identical in every way, except that the latter is a secure SSL
    version.  See <a href="/docs/webSecurity.html">the web server
    security page</a> for more info. The webserver uses the LWP
    library and its sole purpose is to give you an web-based interface
    to TaskForest. I chose to write a perl-based web server because it
    is easy for users to download, install and deploy. Also, it may be
    too much to ask users to install and mantain Apache, and configure
    mod_perl, just to get this web-based access.
  </p>

  <p>
    The behavior of <code>taskforestd</code> is controlled with a
    configuration file, <code>taskforestd.cfg</code>. This configuration
    file <b>must</b> be customized as described below, before you can use
    the web server. Once you have customized the configuration file, you
    can start web server like this:
  </p>

  <div class="code"><pre><code>taskforestd --config_file=taskforestd.cfg

OR
        
taskforestdssl --config_file=taskforestd.cfg</code></pre></div>

  <p>
    You can stop the web server like this:
  </p>

  <div class="code"><pre><code>taskforestd --config_file=taskforestd.cfg --stop

OR
        
taskforestdssl --config_file=taskforestd.cfg --stop</code></pre></div>

  <p>
    For example, if the configuration file specifies that the host on
    which <code>taskforestd</code> runs is www.example.com, then the web server will be
    available at http://www.example.com/ .
  </p>

  <p>
    To use the webserver (or even the web service described later) you
    must have a valid userid and password. <code>taskforestd</code> does
    not ship with any default userid and password pairs. A password is
    required to authenticate the person making requests via the web
    browswer. This userid and password combination may be (and should be)
    different from the userid and password of the account under which
    taskforestd is running.
