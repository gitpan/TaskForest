  <p>
    TaskForest can be configured so that when a job fails, it will
    automatically retry running the job.  There is a system-wide option called
    <a href="/docs/configuring/options.html#num_retries">num_retries</a>
    that specifies how many times the job will be retried.
    The <a href="/docs/configuring/options.html#retry_sleep">retry_sleep</a>
    option specifies how many seconds the system will wait before trying
    to rerun the job.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <a href="/docs/configuring/options.html#num_retries">num_retries</a> and
    <a href="/docs/configuring/options.html#retry_sleep">retry_sleep</a> options may optionally be specified for each job as well.  For example, if the configuration file contains this...
  </p>

  <div class="code"><pre><code><span class="comments"># This is the number of times to automatically</span>
<span class="comments"># retry running a job that fails </span>
<a class="config_file" href="/docs/configuring/options.html#num_retries">num_retries</a>              = 1

<span class="comments"># Wait these many seconds before automatically</span>
<span class="comments"># retrying running a job that fails </span>
<a class="config_file" href="/docs/configuring/options.html#retry_sleep">retry_sleep</a>              = 300
</code></pre></div>

<p>
  ...then if any job fails, the run wrapper will sleep for 300 seconds and
  then retry the job once.  If the retry fails as well, then the job will
  be considered to have failed.  If the retry succeeds, then job will have
  considered to have run successfully.  During 300 second sleep period,
  and during the retries, the official status of the job will still be
  'Running.'
<p>

<p>
  The responsibility of implementing the auto-retries falls on the run
  wrapper.  Even though TaskForest ships with two run wrappers, you really
  should use <code>run_with_log</code> and not <code>run</code>.  When a
  job is being retried, <code>run_with_log</code> will note it the log
  file like this:
</p>

<p>
  You can see that in this case, TaskForest had been instructed to sleep
  for 2 seconds before retrying, and that there was to be only one retry.
</p>  

<p>
  You can also override these configuration settings for individual jobs.
  Let's say you have your configuration file set up as shown above, with
  one retry after 300 seconds.  Now suppose you want
  job <code>J_Retry</code> to be retried 10 times, with a two-minute sleep
  between retries. You could specify the overrides directly in the family
  file as follows:
</p>

  <div class="code"><pre><code>
   +-------------------------------------------------------
01 | ...
02 |
03 | J_Retry (num_retries => 10, retry_sleep => 120)
04 |
05 | ...
   +-------------------------------------------------------
  </code></pre></div>

<p>
  This local specification of ten retries spaced two minutes apart will
  override what you have specified in the configuration file.  You can
  override these configuration options on as many jobs as you wish.
</p>
