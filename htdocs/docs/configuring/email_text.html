<p>
  You can configure TaskForest to send you an email in any of these three situations:
  <ul>
    <li>When a job fails</li>
    <li>When a job fails but will be <a href="/docs/configuring/retry.html">automatically retried</a></li>
    <li>When a job that failed and was <a href="/docs/configuring/retry.html">automatically retried</a> finally succeeds</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  You can configure this feature system-wide via the configuration file,
  and you can also override it for individual jobs in the Family files
  (the same way retries are configured).  You can also completely
  configure the emails going out in each of the three cases, from the
  SMTP envelope information to MIME headers to body text.  Again, this
  can be configured across the entire system and overridden for
  individual jobs and families.  It really is a very powerful system
  that, with the proper email filters, can make managing your job
  workflow very easy.  Let's see how it works.
</p>

<p>
  In order to be able to send emails, you need to provide TaskForest some
  information in the configuration file:
</p>

<div class="code"><pre><code><span class="comments"><span class="comments"># This is the SMTP server that will be used to send </span>
<span class="comments"># emails out when a job fails, for example</span>
<a class="config_file" href="/docs/configuring/options.html#smtp_server">smtp_server</a>              = "localhost"

<span class="comments"># The default SMTP port is 25.</span>
<a class="config_file" href="/docs/configuring/options.html#smtp_port">smtp_port</a>                = 25

<span class="comments"># In a production environment this should be 60 or 120</span>
<a class="config_file" href="/docs/configuring/options.html#smtp_timeout">smtp_timeout</a>             = 60

<span class="comments"># This is the SMTP envelope sender </span>
<span class="comments"># (the text after "MAIL FROM:")</span>
<a class="config_file" href="/docs/configuring/options.html#smtp_sender">smtp_sender</a>                = "user1@example.com"

<span class="comments"># This is the email address that appears in the From: </span>
<span class="comments"># mail header</span>
<a class="config_file" href="/docs/configuring/options.html#mail_from">mail_from</a>                = "user1@example.com"

<span class="comments"># If a user replies to a received email, the reply</span>
<span class="comments"># will go to this address instead of the From: address. </span>
<span class="comments"># This address is set in the Reply-To mail header.</span>
<a class="config_file" href="/docs/configuring/options.html#mail_reply_to">mail_reply_to</a>            = "user2@example.com"

<span class="comments"># This is the address to which bounces will be sent if </span>
<span class="comments"># they occur at the SMTP server (as opposed to the </span>
<span class="comments"># receiving Mail Transfer Agent).</span>
<a class="config_file" href="/docs/configuring/options.html#mail_return_path">mail_return_path</a>         = "user3@example.com"

<span class="comments"># This is the directory that stores the contents of</span>
<span class="comments"># the emails that are sent by the system. </span>
<a class="config_file" href="/docs/configuring/options.html#instructions_dir">instructions_dir</a>         = "instructions"</code></pre></div>

<p>
  Then there are the following three settings that control who receives
  the emails.  They can be set system-wide in the configuration file:
</p>

<div class="code"><pre><code><span class="comments"># When a job fails, emails are sent to this address</span>
<a class="config_file" href="/docs/configuring/options.html#email">email</a>                    = "test@example.com"

<span class="comments"># When a job fails, but is being automatically retried,</span>
<span class="comments"># emails are sent to this address, as opposed to the </span>
<span class="comments"># one stored in the 'email' setting.  If no_retry_mail </span>
<span class="comments"># is set, then no email will be sent in this case</span>
<a class="config_file" href="/docs/configuring/options.html#retry_email">retry_email</a>              = "test2@example.com"

<span class="comments"># When a job fails, is automatically retried one or more </span>
<span class="comments"># times and then suceededs, emails are sent to this </span>
<span class="comments"># address, as opposed to any of the others.  If </span>
<span class="comments"># no_retry_success_email is set, then no email will be sent</span>
<span class="comments"># in this case.</span>
<a class="config_file" href="/docs/configuring/options.html#retry_success_email">retry_success_email</a>      = "test3@example.com"</code></pre></div>

<p>
  Given the setup shown above, the email generated when a job is being
  retried is shown below.  What you see below is a transcript of a SMTP
  session between TaskForest and a fake SMTP server used for testing.
  Lines that start with '<code><em>S: &gt;</em></code>' denote text sent
  from the SMTP server to the client (TaskForest).  Lines that start with
  '<code>C: &lt;</code>' denote text sent from the SMTP client
  (TaskForest) to the SMTP server.
</p>

<div class="code"><pre><code><em>S: &gt; 200 OK TaskForest Fake SMTP Server</em>
<span class="comments">C: &lt; EHLO user1@example.com</span>
<em>S: &gt; 200 OK</em>

<span class="comments">C: &lt; .</span>
<em>S: &gt; 200 OK</em>
<span class="comments">C: &lt; QUIT</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>
  What's left to be explained is how TaskForest chose the email's subject
  and the body of the email.  The subject of the email will contain the
  Family name and Job name preceded by 'RETRY', 'FAIL' or 'RETRY_SUCCESS',
  depending on whether the job failed and is about to
  be <a href="/docs/configuring/retry.html">retried</a> (after
  the <a href="/docs/configuring/options.html#retry_sleep">sleep
  time</a>), or failed for the final time, or succeeded after failing and
  being retried one or more times.
</p>


<p>
  As for the body, TaskForest concatenates the contents of several files
  found
  in <a href="/docs/configuring/options.html#instructions_dir">instructions_dir</a>.
  If the appropriate file does not exist, it will ignore it and move on to
  the next one.  As it retrieves the contents of each file, TaskForest
  does some simple substitutions to replace placeholders found within the
  file's contents with the the value of that variable in the run_wrapper's
  environment.  TaskForest makes all of the environment variables
  available to the <code>taskforest</code> program available to the run
  wrapper (run_with_log) and also adds the following variables to the
  environment:
</p>

<div class=code>
  <dl>
    <dt>TASKFOREST_FAMILY_NAME</dt>

</div>
  
      

<p>
  Let <code>&#36;instructions_dir</code> refer to the value of
  the <code><a href="/docs/configuring/options.html#instructions_dir">instructions_dir</a></code>
  option.  Let's call the reason for the email <code>&#36;reason</code>.
  It's value is one of 'RETRY', 'FAIL', or 'RETRY_SUCCESS' (as described
  above).  Let's also refer to the job name as <code>&#36;job_name</code>,
  and the family name as <code>&#36;family_name</code>.  TaskForest will
  look for the following files in the following order, inserting their
  contents into the email body.
</p>

<div class=code>
  <dl>
    <dt><code>&#36;instructions_dir/HEADER</code></dt>
    <dd>
      This is a header that will show up in every email.  In the example
      that generated the above email, the contents of this file were:
      <div class="codecode"><pre><code>This is the TaskForest system at &#36;HOSTNAME
------------------------------------------------------</code></pre></div>
    </dd>
    
    <dt><code>&#36;instructions_dir/HEADER.&#36;reason</code></dt>
    <dd>
      This is a header that will be displayed just for that reason.  In
      other words, it will be one of three files: HEADER.RETRY, HEADER.FAIL,
      and HEADER.RETRY_SUCCESS.  In the example that generated the above
      email, the name of this file was HEADER.RETRY and it's contents were:
      <div class="codecode"><pre><code>The following job failed and will be rerun automatically.

Family:         &#36;TASKFOREST_FAMILY_NAME
Job:            &#36;TASKFOREST_JOB_NAME
Exit Code:      &#36;TASKFOREST_RC
Retry After:    &#36;TASKFOREST_RETRY_SLEEP seconds
No. of Retries: &#36;TASKFOREST_RETRY of &#36;TASKFOREST_NUM_RETRIES</code></pre></div>
    </dd>
    
    <dt><code>&#36;instructions_dir/FAMILY.&#36;family_name.&#36;reason</code></dt>
    <dd>
      This is file that can contain specific instructions for that family
      and reason.  In the example that generated the above email, the name
      of this file was FAMILY.RETRY.retry and its contents were:
      <div class="codecode"><pre><code>Instructions that apply to all jobs in the Family named RETRY.</code></pre></div>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>&#36;instructions_dir/JOB.&#36;job_name.&#36;reason</code></dt>
    <dd>
      This is file that can contain specific instructions for that job
      and reason.  In the example that generated the above email, the name
      of this file was JOB.J_Retry.retry and its contents were:
      <div class="codecode"><pre><code>Instructions that apply to the jobs named J_Retry.</code></pre></div>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>&#36;instructions_dir/FOOTER.&#36;reason</code></dt>
    <dd>
      This is a footer that will be displayed just for that reason.  In
      other words, it will be one of three files: FOOTER.RETRY,
      FOOTER.FAIL, and FOOTER.RETRY_SUCCESS.  In the example that
      generated the above email, the name of this file would have been
      FOOTER.RETRY, but that file did not exist, so TaskForest skipped
      over it.
    </dd>
    
    <dt><code>&#36;instructions_dir/FOOTER</code></dt>
    <dd>
      This is a footer that will show up in every email.  In the example
      that generated the above email, the contents of this file were:
      <div class="codecode"><pre><code>------------------------------------------------------------
