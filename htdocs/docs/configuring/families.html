  <div class="section_header">Jobs</div>
  <p>
    A job is defined as any executable program that resides on the file
    system. It is represented as a file in the files system whose name is
    the same as the job name.  Jobs can depend on each other. Jobs can
    also have start times before which a job may not by run.
  </p>

  <p>
    When a job is run by the run wrapper (bin/run), two status semaphore files are
    created in the <a href="/docs/configuring/options.html#log_dir">log directory</a>.  The first is created when a job starts
    and has a name of <code>&#036;FamilyName.&#036;JobName.pid</code>.  This file contains some
    attributes of the job.  When the job completes, more attributes are
    written to this file.  
  </p>

  <p>
    When the job completes, another semaphore file is written to the <a href="/docs/configuring/options.html#log_dir">log directory</a>.
    The name of this file will be <code>&#036;FamilyName.&#036;JobName.0</code> if the job ran
    successfully, and <code>&#036;FamilyName.&#036;JobName.1</code> if the job failed.  In either
    case, the file will contain the exit code of the job (0 in the case of
    success and non-zero otherwise).
  </p>

  <p>
    When a job is run by the <code>run_with_log</code> run wrapper, any
    output the job sends to stdout or stderr will be captured and stored
    in a file
    called <code>&#036;FamilyName.&#036;JobName.&#036;pid.&#036;start_time.stdout</code>
    in the <a href="/docs/configuring/options.html#log_dir">log directory</a>.
  </p>

  
  <div class="new_section_header"><a name="job_status">Job Status</a></div>
  <p>
    Within TaskForest, every job has a status, which is one of the
    following values:
  </p>
  <ul class="bullet">
    <li><b>Waiting</b> - One or more dependencies of the job have not been
    met.</li>
    <li><b>Ready</b> - All dependencies have been met; the job will run
    during the next iteration of the <a href="/docs/runningTaskForest.html#main_loop"><code>taskforest</code>
    main loop</a>.</li>
    <li><b>Running</b> - The job is currently running</li>
    <li><b>Success</b> - The job has run successfully</li>
    <li><b>Failure</b> - The job was run, but the program exited with a
    non-zero return code</li>
  </ul>
    
  
  <div class="new_section_header">Jobs &amp; Families</div>
  <p>
    Jobs can be grouped together into ``Families.'' A family has a start
    time associated with it before which none of its jobs may run. A
    family also has a list of days-of-the-week associated with it. Jobs
    within a family may only run on these days of the week.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jobs and families are given simple names. A family is described in a
    family file whose name is the family name. Each family file is a text
    file that contains 1 or more job names. The layout of the job names
    within a family file determine the dependencies between the jobs (if
    any).  There are <a href="/about/text.html">several reasons why text files are a good choice for
    Family files</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Family names and job names should contain only the characters shown
    below: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789_
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's see a few examples. In these examples the dashes (-), pipes (|)
    and line numbers are not parts of the files. They're only there for
    illustration purposes. The main script expects environment variables
    or command line options or configuration file settings that specify
    the locations of the directory that contain family files, the
    directory that contains job files, and the directory where the logs
    will be written. The directory that contains family files should
    contain only family files.
  </p>

  <div class="new_section_header">EXAMPLE 1 - Family file named F_ADMIN</div>
  <div class="code"><pre><code>
   +-------------------------------------------------------
01 |start => '02:00', tz => 'GMT', days => 'Mon,Wed,Fri'
02 |
03 | J_ROTATE_LOGS()
04 |
   +-------------------------------------------------------
  </code></pre></div>

  <p>
    The first line in any family file always contains 3 bits of
    information about the family: the start time, the time zone, and the
    days on which this jobs in this family are run.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this case, this family starts at 2:00 a.m. Chicago time.  The time
    is adjusted for daylight savings time.  This family 'runs' on Monday,
    Wednesday and Friday only.  Pay attention to the format: it's
    important.
  </p>
  <p> 
    Valid days are 'Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun'.  Days
    must be separated by commas. 
  </p>
  <p> 
    All start times (for families and jobs) are in 24-hour format. '00:00'
    is midnight, '12:00' is noon, '13:00' is 1:00 p.m. and '23:59' is one
    minute before midnight. 
  </p>
  <p> 
    There is only one job in this family - J_ROTATE_LOGS.  This family
    will start at 2:00 a.m., at which time J_ROTATE_LOGS will immediately
    be run.  Note the empty parentheses [()].  These are required.  
  </p>
  <p> 
    What does it mean to say that J_ROTATE_LOGS will be run?  It means
    that the system will look for a file called J_ROTATE_LOGS in the
    directory that contains job files.  That file should be executable.
    The system will execute that file (run that job) and keep track of
    whether it succeeded or failed.  The J_ROTATE_LOGS script can be any
    executable file: a shell script, a perl script, a C program etc. 
  </p>
  <p> 
    To run the program, the system actually runs a wrapper script that
    invokes the job script.  The location of the wrapper script is
    specified on the command line or in an environment variable. 
  </p>
  <p> 
    Now, let's look at a slightly more complicated example:
  </p>

  <div class="new_section_header">EXAMPLE 2 - Job Dependencies</div>
  <p>
    This family file is named WEB_ADMIN.
  </p>
  <div class="code"><pre><code>
   +-------------------------------------------------------
01 |start => '02:00', tz => 'GMT', days => 'Mon,Wed,Fri'
02 |
03 |               J_ROTATE_LOGS()
04 |
05 | J_RESOLVE_DNS()       Delete_Old_Logs()
06 |
07 |               J_WEB_REPORTS()      
08 |
09 |    J_EMAIL_WEB_RPT_DONE()  # send me a notification
10 |
   +-------------------------------------------------------
  </code></pre></div>

  <p>
    A few things to point out here:
  </p>

  <ul class=bullet>
    <li>Blank lines are ignored.
    </li>
    <li>
      A hash (#) and anything after it, until the end of the line is
      treated as a comment and ignored.
    </li>
    <li>
      Job and family names do not have to start with J_ or be in upper
      case.
    </li>
  </ul>



  <div class="new_section_header">EXAMPLE 3 - Time Dependencies</div>
  <p>
    Let's say tha twe don't want J_RESOLVE_DNS to start before 9:00
    a.m. because it's very IO-intensive and we want to wait until the
    relatively quiet time of 9:00 a.m.  In that case, we can put a time
    dependency of the job. This adds a restriction to the job, saying that
    it may not run before the time specified.  We would do this as follows:
  </p>
  <div class="code"><pre><code>
   +-------------------------------------------------------
01 |start => '02:00', tz => 'GMT', days => 'Mon,Wed,Fri'
02 |
03 |               J_ROTATE_LOGS()
04 |
05 | J_RESOLVE_DNS(start => '09:00')  Delete_Old_Logs()
06 |
07 |               J_WEB_REPORTS()      
08 |
09 |    J_EMAIL_WEB_RPT_DONE()  # send me a notification
10 |
   +-------------------------------------------------------
  </code></pre></div>

  <p>
    J_ROTATE_LOGS will still start at 2:00, as always.  As soon as it
    succeeds, Delete_Old_Logs is started.  If J_ROTATE_LOGS
    succeeds before 09:00, the system will wait until 09:00 before
    starting J_RESOLVE_DNS.  It is possible that
    Delete_Old_Logs would have started and complete by then.
    J_WEB_REPORTS would not have started in that case, because it is
    dependent on two jobs, and both of them have to run successfully
    before it can run.
  </p>
  <p>
    For completeness, you may also specify a timezone for a job's time
    dependency as follows: 
  </p>

  <div class="code"><pre><code>05 | J_RESOLVE_DNS(start=>'10:00', tz=>'America/New_York') ...</code></pre></div>

  <div class="new_section_header">EXAMPLE 4 - Job Forests</div>
  <p>
    You can see in the example above that line 03 is the start of a group
    of dependent job.  No job on any other line can start unless the job
    on line 03 succeeds.  What if you wanted two or more groups of jobs in
    the same family that start at the same time (barring any time
    dependencies) and proceed independently of each other?
  </p>
  <p>
    To do this you would separate the groups with a line containing one or
    more dashes (only).  Consider the following family:
  </p>

  <div class="code"><pre><code>
   +-------------------------------------------------------
01 |start => '02:00', tz => 'GMT', days => 'Mon,Wed,Fri'
02 |
03 |               J_ROTATE_LOGS()
04 |
05 | J_RESOLVE_DNS(start => '09:00')    Delete_Old_Logs()
06 |
07 |               J_WEB_REPORTS()      
08 |
09 |    J_EMAIL_WEB_RPT_DONE()  # send me a notification
10 |
11 |-------------------------------------------------------
12 |
13 | J_UPDATE_ACCOUNTS_RECEIVABLE()
14 |
15 | J_ATTEMPT_CREDIT_CARD_PAYMENTS()
16 |
17 |-------------------------------------------------------
18 |
19 | J_SEND_EXPIRING_CARDS_EMAIL()
20 |
   +-------------------------------------------------------
</code></pre></div>

  <p>
    Because of the lines of dashes on lines 11 and 17, the jobs on lines
    03, 13 and 19 will all start at 02:00.  These jobs are independent of
    each other.  J_ATTEMPT_CREDIT_CARD_PAYMENT will not run if
    J_UPDATE_ACCOUNTS_RECEIVABLE fails.  That failure, however will not
    prevent J_SEND_EXPIRING_CARDS_EMAIL from running.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, you can specify a job to run repeatedly every 'n' minutes, as
    follows: 
  </p>

  <div class="code"><pre><code>
   +-------------------------------------------------------
01 |start => '02:00', tz => 'GMT', days => 'Mon,Wed,Fri'
02 |
03 | J_CHECK_DISK_USAGE(every=>'30', until=>'23:00')
04 |
   +-------------------------------------------------------
</code></pre></div>

  <p>
    This means that J_CHECK_DISK_USAGE will be called every 30 minutes and
    will not run on or after 23:00.  By default, the 'until' time is
    23:59.  If the job starts at 02:00 and takes 25 minutes to run to
    completion, the next occurance will still start at 02:30, and not at
    02:55.  By default, every repeat occurrance will only have one
    dependency - the time - and will not depend on earlier occurances
    running successfully or even running at all.  If line 03 were:
    </p>
  
  <div class="code"><pre><code>J_CHECK_DISK_USAGE(every=>'30', until=>'23:00', chained=>1)</code></pre></div>

  <p>
    ...then each repeat job will be dependent on the previous occurance.

  </p>
