  <p>
    Several of the features currently in TaskForest are a result of user
    requests.  If you would like to see a feature implemented, please send
    me a message via
    the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/taskforest/">TaskForest
    SourceForge page</a>.  
  </p>

  <p>
    The only company I know of that provides commercial support for
    TaskForest is <a href="http://www.activmindz.com/">ActivMindz, Inc.</a>
