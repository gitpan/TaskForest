To install the module, use the standard procedure:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

The run_wrapper and the main taskforest script will be installed in the
bin subdirectory of the directory from which you're performing this
installation.

I have recently added a lot more tests to the system than there were
before. Please let me know if your tests fail for any reason.  I've tested
the system out on Linux and Mac OS X.
