  
Revision history for Perl module TaskForest

1.36 Tue Feb 23 2010
o Added a button to the logs form on the website that pops up a calendar
  window to help you select a date.  Many thanks to Steve Hulet for
  providing the patch.
o The logs display page on the website now has links to navigate to the
  previous and next days.  Many thanks to Steve Hulet for providing the
  patch.
o Fixed some more test cases that wouldn't run properly during certain times
  of the day.

1.35 Thu Feb 11 2010
o Added support for a default time zone to taskforestd.cfg
o Fixed a problem that occurs when you rerun a job and remove it from the
  family before the job has a chance of rerunning.
o Added log_date option to mark, release and rerun
o If a job fails, its status line on the web page is now colored
o Prune out carriage returns from job files
o Added the ability to put a job on hold, and release a hold
o Fixed a few test cases that wouldn't run properly during certain times
  of the day.

1.33 Mon Jun 1 2009
o Added support for external dependencies (jobs depending on jobs that are
  in other families.
o Removed the VERSION string from all the .pm files, and moved it to 
  Makefile.PL.  Thils will mean less diffs between versions.
o Got rid of unused code.
o Improved some test cases, to reduce the risk of false test failures.  
o Fixed a bug where the last entry of a recurring job was sometimes not
  run.
o Modified taskforestd and taskforestdssl to accept the 'chained' option
  in the config file.   

1.26 Tue May 19 2009
o There was an unnecessary call to 'use Date::Calc' in Calendar.pm.  I
  didn't notice it, because I have it installed. It is not being used. It
  may cause tests to fail.  I have removed the line. 

1.25 Mon May 18 2009
o TaskForest now supports calendars.  A calendar is a set of rules that
  defines on what days a job may run.  Each rule can may or may not
  conclusively determine whether or not a Family should run today.  The
  rules are evaluated in the order in which they are specified.  The last
  rule that conclusively determines whether of not a Family should run
  wins, in the case of conflicting rules.  If none of the rules is
  conclusive, then the Family will not run today.  You can set rules to
  specify certain dates or ranges of dates, or specific days, like "third
  friday of every month."

o Fixed small bug in REST website where logs were not being displayed for
  jobs that ran earlier today (but yesterday by its family's timezone)

o Added an FAQ section.  

1.24 Sun Apr 26 2009
o This release introduces the concept of tokens.  A token is a new kind of
  dependency.  If a job depends on a token, it must acquire a free token
  before it can run, or wait for another job to release a token after
  completion.  Since there is a finite set of tokens, you can use tokens
  to prevent too many jobs from running at the same time.
  For example, if there are 20 jobs that rely on token T, but only 5
  instances of the token, only a maximum of 5 of those jobs may run at the
  same time.
o This release also formalizes the way Families with foreign time zones
  are handled.  This allows you to 'time shift' your family, essentially
  allowing your family to run for 24 hours in a later timezone.  This
  shifts the end of day towards the end of the family's running time.

1.23 Tue Mar 24 2009
o This release fixes a nasty bug where Family files were not being parsed
  properly if the files were in DOS format (with CRLF endings, instead of
  just LF).  Unfortunately, most web browsers save textarea text with
  CRLF, so a Family file that was originally in Unix format (LF) could
  wind up being in DOS (CRLF) format if you edited it via the website.

1.22 Mon Mar 23 2009
o Added the ability to release all dependencies from a job.  This makes
  the job available to run immediately, regardless of how many jobs it is
  supposed to wait for, or what time dependency it has.  Releasing a job
  effectively changes its status from 'Waiting' to 'Ready.'  This option
  is only available to jobs that are currently in the 'Waiting' state.
o Fixed a minor bug where status on the website was sometimes showing a
  previous day's status if the website had been up for more than a day.
o Added a line break between the words in the headers in the status and
  log pages on the website, so that the table doesn't take up too much
  horizontal space.
o Eliminated a debug message saying that the ignore_regex option changed
  every time the system cycled. 

1.21 Thu Mar 12 2009
o Fixed a bug that was causing the rerun and mark commands run with the
  --cascade or --dependents_only flag to print an error message when
  there was, in fact, no error, and possibly exit before rerunning or
  marking all requested jobs.

1.20 Mon Mar 09 2009
o Fixed a bug where the end time wasn't being calculated properly.
o Added some licensing text to comply with yui licensing requirements.


1.19 Sat Mar 07 2009
o In Log page, successful job should show 'mark Failure' not 'mark Success'.  
o Added log_date to website to make Rerun/Mark of a job from a previous
  day work as expected
o Changed RESTful service header and docs - added log_date


1.18 Fri Mar 06 2009

All of the changes in this release are related to the website.
o Made sure that if a job file dies after the fork but before ceding
  control back to the wrapper, you can at least see its log, if it was run
  with run_with_log
o The website now shows the log file for running jobs, not just jobs that
  have completed.
o Fixed bug where marking a job as Success was not working after it had
  been marked as Failure
o Moved mark and rerun forms to buttons on the status and logs tables
o Changed website to a horizontal layout, so that we have the full window 
  width for tables 
o Fixed a bug so that rerun jobs log files are displayed correctly on the
  web site. 
o Added 'Cache-Control: Public' HTTP response header to allow Firefox 3 to
  cache SSL pages which it does not do by default. This greatly improves
  website performance if you're using Firefox 3.  Firefox 2 does not
  support the Cache-Control response header, so the website will be slower
  if you're using SSL and Firefox 2 or earlier.
o Added the 'help' and 'about' documentation sections to the website.


1.17 Sat Feb 21 2009

The major change in this release is the addition of an alternative run
wrapper script called run_with_log.  It performs the same functions as the
original wrapper, and also creates a log file that captures both STDOUT
and STDERR of the job being run.  On the website you can now display the
log file of any running or completed job, by clicking on the displayed
status of the job.  The RESTful web service also supports this.  A couple
of entries have also been added to the HOWTO section of the documentation.

1.16 Wed Feb 18 2009

Minor bug fix.  An incorrect test job file was shipped in the previous
version.  This file relied on /bin/bash, and not /bin/sh.  This caused
test 017 to fail on any machine that did not have /bin/bash.  The file has
been fixed in this release.  

1.15 Sun Feb 15 2009

The ordering of jobs displayed by the status command was changed.  The
status command now accepts a --date option, to view jobs that ran on a
previous date.  When run for the current day, the status command now also
displays all jobs that ran that are not currently in any Family.  This
handles the case where the jobs are removed from family files intra-day,
after running.  These jobs are displayed using the newly-supported
default_time_zone option.

This release also introduces taskforestd, a perl-only web server that
implements a RESTful web service that can be used by programatic clients
to access the Taskforest system.  The web server also includes a web site
that can be used by humans to interact with Taskforest.  The web server
uses Basic Authentication to authenticate the user, so if you wish to use
it outside an intranet, you should use taskforestdssl, the SSL version of
the program.  

1.14 Thu Jan 22 2009

A new config option (and command line argument) was added.  The
ignore_regex option instructs the system to ignore any Family files whose
names match the regular expressions specified by this option.  It's
primarily used to ignore .bak and ~ files left by text editors.  Also
fixed a bug so that invalid file names are excluded.

1.13 Mon Jun 02 2008

The behavior of recurring jobs that are scheduled in a foreign time zone
was not well defined.  Now, the 'start' and 'until' of recurring jobs are
always based on the most specific timezone of the job. 

1.12 Sun Jun 01 2008

A border-condition bug dealing with foreign timezones crossing a date
boundary was fixed. 

1.11 Wed May 28 2008

Minor errors in the documentation and logging
were fixed. A test case that was returing
false negatives was made more robust. 

1.10 Mon May 26 2008

Syntax error checking was added to the Family
file parser.  Optional logging of STDOUT and
STDERR is now possible.  The mark and rerun
commands can now act on just the job specified,
or on all its dependents or on both - the job and
its dependents.  Finally, a config file can now
be used in lieu of command-line options or
environment variables. 

New options are:

--log

--config_file

--chained

--log_threshold

--log_file

--err_file

A sample config file can be found in the main
directory as well as in the pod for TaskForest.

Please see the TaskForest pod for more details:
perldoc TaskForest
OR
man TaskForest

Because of these changes, there are two new
dependencies:

Log::Log4perl version 1.16 or higher
Config::General version 2.38 or higher

1.09 Sun Apr 27 2008

    Summary:
     
    Two new scripts were added: 'rerun' schedules
    A job to be rerun, and 'mark' marks a
    previously job as Success or Failure.  A new
    'chained' option was added to the definition
    of repeat jobs, and a '--collapsed' option was
    added to the status script.
    
    Details:
    
    1) The 'rerun' script makes a job available to be
       rerun, regardless of whether or not it ran
       successfuly.  It does this by renaming the
       job's log files from FF.JJ.* to
       FF.JJ--Orig_n--.* where n is an integer that
       starts at 1 for the first rerun, and is
       incremented by one at every rerun.
    
    2) The 'mark' job marks a job as 'Success' or
       'Failure', regardless of whether or not it ran
       successfully.  It does this by renaming the job
       rc file from FF.JJ.x to FF.JJ.0 (in the case of
       Success) or FF.JJ.1 (in the case of Failure).
       If the job's status is already as requested, a
       warning is printed, and nothing is done.
    
    3) By default, repeat jobs (those that have the
       'every' and 'until' options) have only one
       dependency - their time dependency.  They are
       not dependent on each other.  In retrospect,
       the correct behavior should have been to make
       the jobs also dependent on each other.
       Consider the case where a job is to run every
       hour, but for whatever reason, taskforest does
       not run until half-way through the day.  This
       would cause half of the jobs to run at the same
       time at the first opportunity.  The new
       'chained' option makes the repeat jobs
       dependent on each other.
    
    4) Also related to repeat jobs: the new
       --collapsed option to the status command
       prevents repeat jobs that are in the 'Waiting'
       state from being displayed.  This is especially
       useful when you have a job scheduled to be run
       once every minute, and it's only 8:00 a.m.  You
       probably wouldn't want to see 960 entries when
       one would suffice.
    
1.08 Mon Apr 07 20:52:00 2008
     A couple of the files required for the most recent test case was
     missing from the distribution.  Added those files to the
     distribution.  No code changes are present in this distribution.
     
1.07 Sun Apr 06 20:50:00 2008
     A major bug was fixed in this release. Long-running jobs (that ran for
     longer than the wait time, or longer than the time between two
     invocations of taskforest) were not recognized as such.  This caused
     the jobs to be marked as 'Ready' and not 'Running', causing them to
     be run again.  All users are urged to upgrade to this release and
     make sure to use the current version of the 'run' wrapper.
