Revision history for Perl module TaskForest

1.08 Mon Apr 07 20:52:00 2008
     A couple of the files required for the most recent test case was
     missing from the distribution.  Added those files to the
     distribution.  No code changes are present in this distribution.
1.07 Sun Apr 06 20:50:00 2008
     A major bug was fixed in this release. Long-running jobs (that ran for
     longer than the wait time, or longer than the time between two
     invocations of taskforest) were not recognized as such.  This caused
     the jobs to be marked as 'Ready' and not 'Running', causing them to
     be run again.  All users are urged to upgrade to this release and
     make sure to use the current version of the 'run' wrapper.
